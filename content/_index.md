**Hola!** I'm Jorge, a Spanish Machine Learning software developer and occasional musician currently living in
Copenhagen. Welcome to my website!

Here, I share what Iâ€™m working on, the challenges I face, and the solutions I come up with, sometimes with a
bit of humor. If you've got questions or just want to chat, don't hesitate to get in touch. Thanks for
stopping by!
